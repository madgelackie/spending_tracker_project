# PokÃ©money Spending Tracker

It was a solo project completed during week 5 of the 16-week immersive Codecland Professional Software Development course.


Usage
------
The app allows a user to set a budget, add spending types/merchants and add transactions.  This met the MVP of our brief.
Additional functionailty was added for sorting transactions by amount and by date, as well as a feature that gives a visual reminder when spending is close to or has exceeded the set budget.
The intended user is a PokÃ©mon traniner, just to keep it a bit more interesting ðŸ˜„


How to run
------
1. Install Python if you don't already have it.  You can get it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. In the terminal, install Flask:
```pip3 install Flask```

3. Whilst in the app's directory, run:
```flask run```
